# Falsifiability
Karl Popper believed that **scientific knowledge is provisional** – the best we can do at the moment.<br>
The **falsification principle** (aka just **falsifiability** or **Popper's criterion**) was proposed by **Karl Popper**.<br>
**Falsifiability** is a **criterion** of **demarcating** (**distinguishing**) **science** from **non-science**.

<br>

Falsification uses the inference rule **modus tollens**: if from **law** `L` we logically deduce **hypothesis**/**prediction** `H` but then we observe that `H` is `false`, we **infer** that **law** `L` is `false` too.

<br>

According to Popper, scientific theory should make **predictions that can be tested**. If *theory* can **not** be falsified it is **non-science**.<br>

<br>

Popper **contrasted** falsifiability (**deductive reasoning**) to the similar concept of **verifiability** (**inductive reasoning**):
- in **inductive reasoning** *general conclusions* are based on **specific** observations or patterns and the researcher looks for examples that only **confirm** this *general conclusions*;
- in **deductive reasoning** all hypotheses **can be tested** through experimentation or further observation;

<br>

So,  **deductive reasoning** is more **acceptable** for science. In other words, **no matter** how many observations are made which confirm a theory, there is always the possibility that a future observation could refute it. Induction cannot yield certainty.<br>

For example, the *hypothesis* that “all swans are white” **can be falsified** by observing a **black swan**.<br>
