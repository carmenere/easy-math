Suppose that a **universal set** `U` has been fixed, and that `A` and `B` are a subset of `U`.

# Cartesian product
**Cartesian product** of two sets `A` and `B`, denoted `A × B`, is the set of all **ordered pairs** `(a, b)` (**2-tuples**) where `a` is in `A` and `b` is in `B`.<br>
An **ordered pair** `⟨a,b⟩` has the property that `⟨a,b⟩ = ⟨c,d⟩` **if and only if** `a = c` and `b = d`.<br>

The **cardinality** of the **cartesian product** is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets: `|A × B| = |A| · |B|`.<br>
