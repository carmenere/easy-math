# Powerset
The **power set** (or **powerset**) of a set `S` is the **set** of **all subsets** of `S`, including the **empty set** and `S` itself.<br>

The **power set** is denoted as `P(S)`.<br>

If `S` is the set `{x, y, z}`, then all the subsets of `S` are
- `{}`
- `{x}`
- `{y}`
- `{z}`
- `{x, y}`
- `{x, z}`
- `{y, z}`
- `{x, y, z}`

and hence the **power set** of `S` is `{{}, {x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y}, {x, z}, {y, z}, {x, y, z}}`.

<br>

**Cardinality** of a set is a measure of the number of elements of the set.<br>
If `S` is a **finite set** with the **cardinality** `|S| = n`, then the **cardinality** of its **powerset** is `|P(S)| = 2‚Åø`.
