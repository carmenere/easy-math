# Markov process
**Markov property** of the system, meaning that **next state** depends on the **only current state**.<br>
In other words, the **markov property** states that a *stochastic process* **has no memory**.<br>

**Markov chain** or **Markov process** is a stochastic process that satisfies the **markov property**.<br>

There are 2 types:
- **discrete-time markov chain**;
- **continuous-time markov chain**;
