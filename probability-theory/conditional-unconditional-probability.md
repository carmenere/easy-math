# Probability
## Unconditional probability
The **unconditional probability** of `A` measures the chance of event `A` without depending on any other event.<br>
The **unconditional probability** of `A` is usually written as `P(A)`.<br>

<br>

## Conditional probability
The **conditional probability** of `A` **given that** `B` measures the chance of event `A` **given that** another event `B` has occurred.<br>
The **conditional probability** of `A` **given that** `B` is usually written as `P(A|B)`.<br>

### Properties
- `P(A|B)` **may** or **may not** be equal to `P(A)`;
- `P(A|B)` **differs** from `P(B|A)`;

## Independent events
If `P(A|B) = P(A)` and `P(B|A) = P(B)`, then events `A` and `B` are **independent**.

<br>

## Joint probability
The term **joint probability** measures the likelihood of **two events occurring together** and at the same point in time.<br>
The **joint probability** of `A` and `B` is usually written as `P(A∩B)`.<br>

The **joint probability** of `A` and `B` differ when they are **independent** and **dependent**:
1. When events `A` and `B` are **independent**: `P(A∩B) = P(A) x P(B)`.
2. When events `A` and `B` are **dependent**: `P(A∩B) = P(A|B)*P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A)`.
