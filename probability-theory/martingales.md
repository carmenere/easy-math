# Martingales
**Property of martingale** (**martingale property**): `E[Xt+1|𝓕] = E[Xt+1|X0...Xt] = Xt`.<br>
A **stochastic process** is a **martingale** if it has **property of martingale**.<br>

In other words, the **martingale property** states that the **future expectation** `E` of a stochastic process is **equal** to the current value of **expectation**.
Knowledge of the past will be of no use in predicting future winnings.

# Examples of martingales
A **random ±1 walk** is a **martingale**.
